Proper install is coming. I apologize for the current
mess. It was developed on a Windows machine with few
tools and no internet during a train ride and suffered
a few rewrites so the filenames aren't very descriptive
anymore.


To run, type:

python Amphetype.py


Depends on:

python-qt4
python-matplotlib
